You are encouraged to structure your course\nhowever works best for your class. All of your course\ninformation could be on a single page, or you might have a different\nnumber of topics, or organize weekly, or any other organization that\nworks for you.\n\nTO UPDATE THIS PAGE: Open and edit the topic_1.Rmd file,\nin the project root, to delete this placeholder text and customize with\nyour own!\n\nAdd a site page\nThe quick version:\nMake a new R Markdown document, save\nAdd the rendered .html to _site.yaml so the page exists on the\nsite\nBuild to see updated site\nBelow for a bit more detail…\nMake each page an R\nMarkdown document\nTo make a new page:\nWithin your website Project, create a new .Rmd (File > New\nFile > R Markdown). Save it to the project root. For this example,\nlet’s say you’ve saved it as new_page.Rmd.\nIn that .Rmd file, remove everything but the title (which you can\nchange) from the YAML - that’s the top section of the .Rmd, where by\ndefault it has title, author, date, etc.\nUpdate the .Rmd to contain whatever you want to have on that\npage. Don’t know a lot about markdown? Considering switching over to the\nVisual\nEditor in RStudio (versions >= 1.4).\nSave the .Rmd\nAdd it to your navigation\nbar\nOpen the _site.yml file in your Project\nAdd the information to the YAML navbar section, which will almost\nalways be the text that you want to appear in the navigation bar, and\nthe file name of the knitted html that will be\nautomatically rendered to /docs when you Build your website. That would\nbe new_page.html for this example (since the .Rmd it is\nrendered from is new_page.Rmd). So in the\n_site.yml I would need to add this to the navbar\nsection:\n    - text: \"A new page!\"\n      href: new_page.html\nNote: YAML is space & indentation specific.\nFollow the structure that already exists in this template to avoid YAML\nerrors.\nHow is the website finding the html? Notice in the\n_site.yml file, the output_dir is set to\ndocs. That means when we press ‘Build website’ (in the\nBuild tab in RStudio), our .Rmd pages are knitted to HTML & sent to\nthe _docs folder. This is also important because when we\ndeploy the site (make it live), we will want to deploy from that\ndocs folder using GitHub pages.\nTake a look at some other pages in this template (Resources,\nAssignments, etc.) to see the structure, & give it a shot!\nDelete/disappear a site page\nThe safest thing to do if you don’t want a page to show up\nis to remove it from the _site.yml navbar listings. That\nway, the material on the page still exists as a file in your project,\nbut doesn’t show up on the website – don’t delete a page file unless you\nare REALLY SURE that you’re never going to want the material on that\npage ever again.\n\n\n\n",
